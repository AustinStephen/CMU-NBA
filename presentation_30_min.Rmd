## Why Fatigue?  

<span> 1.</span> Player Performance

???
The literature is very clear that insufficient rest worsens althlete preformance. 

"Early identification and subsequent management of fatigue may prevent detrimental 
physical and physiological adaptations often associated with injury and enhance 
athletic performance and player availability"
Edwards et al The National Center for Biotechnology Information

### The Cavaliers also cross far less timezones than the coastal teams

## Findings  

1. In-game distance measures currently lack the granularity to study player fatigue 

--

2. A subset of schedule induced factors impact game outcomes 

--

3. Impact of travel has decreased over time

1. In-game distance measures lack the granularity to measure player fatigue.

2. Only a few schedule induced factors have a measurable impact on game outcomes

## What is Fatigue?

- Cannot use direct measures  

--

- Identify events that fatigue players
--

  - Ex. Distance run, timezone change, etc.

???
You cannot identify a proxy for something you don't understand.

More concrete on fatigue: 
"the decline in objective performance measures derived from the capacity 
of the nervous system and contractile properties of muscles over time"
Edwards et al. The National Center for Biotechnology Information

In a perfect world we would directly measure an NBA players internal homeostasis
either with hematological techniques or with sensors that measure heart rate. 
However, players cannot wear heart rate monitors or tracking equipment in 
games and we certainly don't have data about in/post-game blood samples 
so we need a proxy to measure how fatigued a player was by in game events.

## Sources of Fatigue

1. In-game events  

2. Between game events

???
2 major sources for measuring volume of strain that could induce player fatigue.

## In-Game Distance

 tracking_player <- read_csv(
   "data/in_game_distance_data/tracking_by_player_season_daily_2018_19.csv")


 tracking_player %>%
   select(c("player_name","date","min", "dist_miles","dist_miles_off", "dist_miles_def",
            "avg_speed","avg_speed_off","avg_speed_def")) %>%
   rename("Name" = player_name,
          "Distance (mi)" = dist_miles,
          "Distance Offense"  = dist_miles_off,
          "Distance Defense" = dist_miles_def,
          "Speed (mph)" = avg_speed,
          "Speed Offense" = avg_speed_off,
          "Speed Defense" = avg_speed_def,
          "Date" = date,
